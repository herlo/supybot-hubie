githubie
========

githubie (pronounced git hew bee) is a plugin that provides updates 
and allows queries to the github issue interface using events. While 
hubot (https://github.com/github/hubot) is nice, it's a bit overkill 
for managing just issues and statuses. 

It is possible githubie will grow to a much greater state and allow
more interaction to registered users and allow gists and more. For now,
however, githubie just focuses on issues and event notifications from
github.
